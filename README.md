## Conscious (Chrome/Firefox extension)

**Hides the news feed and/or displays how many times you've visited Facebook today. Stay conscious.**

Prevents you from wasting time on Facebook.

"Conscious" makes you more aware of each time you visit Facebook mechanically, without really thinking about it.

Get rid of that habit, save some time and do meaningful things instead!
